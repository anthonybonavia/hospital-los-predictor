Regression (continuous LOS):

MAE = 3.73 days means you’re typically within about ±4 days of the true length‐of‐stay.

R² = 0.71 tells you ~71 % of the variation in LOS is being explained by your current 11 inputs.

Classification (LOS > 10 days):

AUC = 0.977 is outstanding—your model almost perfectly ranks “long‐stay” vs. “short‐stay.”

Accuracy ≈ 0.91 and F1 ≈ 0.91 show you’re both precise and balanced in how you call positives vs. negatives.
